# BSQ

# BSQ is about finding the bigest square in a X by Y matrix with obstacles randomly placed into the matrix.

Created between 16 and 17 june 2022 on windows 10

# Download
``` git clone https://github.com/Vilucas/BSQ.git ```

# Build and create a map
``` make ; perl mapGenerator.pl 100 100 5 > map1 ``` this will build the project and create a 100x100 matrix with an obstacle density of 5 by row

# launch
```./BSQ map1 > result1 ; cat result1``` We redicted it into a file as printing on the terminal is very very slow

# This project has educative purposes in the scope of my work at European Leadership University
